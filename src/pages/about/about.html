    <p><strong>MounTrack</strong> is simple <strong>Ionic/Cordova</strong> app used for tracking your favorite hiking
      places.</p>
    <p>
      In essence, the place is just a set of named GPS coordinates, but <strong>MounTrack</strong> allows you to give
      them a short description, or even to take a photo of a place. Of course, you can edit place later if there is
      something you don't like about it.</p>
    <p><strong>MounTrack</strong> was developed for MOSIS (mobile systems and services) homework assignment by Mladen
      Stojanović and Mihajlo Ilijić.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, <strong>MounTrack</strong> serves as a prototype for PeakTracktion, Android app which is to be
      developed for the same class.</p>
